# Video_Synth-ETC_Mother_and-Modes
A Video Synth developed from the Critter and Guitari ETC Video Synth

## The Critter and Guitari ETC synth updated to work with Python3, tested on Python 3.7. Here are the fixes and updates:
* All print statements updated
* unicode and unichr funcitions update to str() and char()
* Many of the pygame drawing functions (like line and circle) were failing due to a float being passed, when an int was expected. These floats were converted in ints.
